        ],
        "correct_answer": "Lists are mutable (can be changed); Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed).",
        "hint": "Think of a Tuple as a 'sealed' shipment and a List as an open box.",
        "explanation": "Once you define a Tuple `(1, 2)`, you cannot add or remove items. A List `[1, 2]` allows you to append, pop, or change items dynamically."

        "correct_answer": "By using indentation (whitespace).",
        "hint": "Python is famous for forcing you to organize your code visually.",
        "explanation": "Python does not use braces `{}` to wrap code blocks. Instead, it strictly enforces indentation. If your spacing is off, the code will fail with an `IndentationError`."

        "explanation": "If you test the model on the same data it learned from, it might score 100% by pure memorization (overfitting). The Test Set proves it actually 'learned' the concept."
